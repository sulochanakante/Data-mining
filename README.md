# Data-mining
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing &amp; Insurance.

## Project Ttile:
### Bank Customer Segmentation and Insurance Claim Prediction

## Course: Data Mining
 The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies.
 Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

## Skills & Tools Covered
#### Clustering
#### CART
#### Random Forest
#### Artificial Neural Networks

## Problem 1: Clustering
 A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers. 
 They collected a sample that summarizes the activities of users during the past few months.
 Please note that it is a summarized data that contains the average values in all the columns considering all the months, and not for any particular month. 
 You are given the task to identify the segments based on credit card usage.

## Dataset for Problem 1: 
bank_marketing_part1_Data.csv

## Problem 2: CART-RF-ANN
 An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. 
 The management decides to collect data from the past few years.
 You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. 
 Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.
